# What is Deckle?

Deckle helps board game designers and hobbyists create game components quickly and easily. Whether you're prototyping a new game or preparing files for print-on-demand services, Deckle streamlines the design process.

The overarching project goal is to provide tools to help game designers and developers design, prototype, playtest and iterate upon their game ideas.

{% alert 'Please note: Deckle is a work in progress and currently extremely early in development. Much is incomplete, and there\'s waaay more still to come', 'warning' %}

### Features

- **Project Management**: Organize your game components into projects
- **Component Designer**: Create custom components, such as cards, player mats and game boards
- **Data Integration**: Connect to Google Sheets to automatically create and update entire decks
- **Export Ready**: Generate print-ready files for your game components

_And more of a meta one aimed at the devs/technically-minded among us:_

- **Source Available**: All Deckle code is public. If there's something you think needs improving then go for it! No need to file an issue and wait for me to get to it; just fork the repo, make the change, and PR it back to the main project when complete

### Future Goals

I'm not 100% sure on these yet, hopefully by the time I'm nearing in to them there'll be something of a community around Deckle that can help steer the project. However a couple of ideas that are kicking around in the back of my mind are:

- **Easy export to print on demand services**: 
- **Shareable project pages.** Possibly with free/paid PNP download options
- **Playable prototypes**: As well as exports to TTS / Tabletopia / Screentop etc, I'm considering a basic way to play Deckle prototypes directly within Deckle, massively cutting down the time it takes to get your game from playable prototyping to experimenting.
- **Design tools**: Design checklists, balancing tools, etc
- **Playtesting**: Playtest journals + tools to help track and analyse results. Feedback gathering + data collection

### Non-Goals

- **High-fidelity design**: I have no interest in creating _the best_ visual design tool. If you're looking to create high-quality designs with advanced printing features like CMYK support etc then head over to the much more mature [Dextrous](https://https://dextrous.com.au/), they've got you covered. The aim of Deckle is _game design_, not graphic design / illustration, so really only looking to create basic prototypes (though hopefully still not totally unattractive).
